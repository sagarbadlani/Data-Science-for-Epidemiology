### Forecasting Epidemics by using Information Spread over Social Media

##### Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that it is difficult and expensive to monitor and predict the spread of a viral infection through the global population. In this project, we understand how social media information diffusion data can help us analyze and forecast the spread of a viral infection through a large population. We use Twitter data about Monkeypox along with the recorded case data to test different models to evaluate the relationship between the two.
